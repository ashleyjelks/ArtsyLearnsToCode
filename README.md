# Welcome to Artsy Learns to Code!

I'm Ashley, a software engineer at Artsy, and I'll be your mentor over the next few months as we embark on this endeavor to get familiar with how to write code!

## Artsy Learns to Code Expectations

You can read more in the intro documents [here.](https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/events/artsy-learns-to-code.md)

- You will be working your way through the [Udacity Intro to JavaScript Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-javascript--ud803)
- Defining and building an application using one of [Artsy's APIs](https://developers.artsy.net/)
- Showing off your hard work in April at [Artsy Learns to Code's Demo Day](https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/events/demo-days.md)

## Learning Resources

Here I'll be posting links to really useful resources to learn specific technologies, programming languages, concepts, etc.

Two wonderful starting points for you, in addition to the JavaScript Udacity course will be:

- [Free Code Camp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)
- [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)

## Git & Github

Git it a programming language that you will use to save your files in version control on Github.

We will review how to get setup in Github in person, but I'm posting this link here if you ever need a quick refresher:

- https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

## Weekly Recaps

We will be meeting on average once a week to review your projects, brainstorm, do a Q&A, share what we've learned, and more. I'll be posting a short update here along with links to any files so that you can always have easy access to them.
